        <h4>Description</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
            You have never had corned beef like this and if you try it, I truly believe you will never go back to the
            traditionally 'boiled' beef. This recipe was given to my mother-in-law during WWII by her Jewish boarding
            house
            owner and it has become a treasured family recipe. Unlike the commonly boiled corned beef, this is a slow
            braise
            that is tender, flavorful, and has a caramelized surface when it's done. I serve it with colcannon, steamed
            cabbage wedges, braised carrots, and parsnips. It is our favorite St. Patrick's/Jewish dinner, but we love
            it so
            much that I cook it year around.

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Discard any flavoring packet from corned beef. Brush brisket with browning sauce on both sides. Heat
                vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and brown brisket on both sides in the hot oil, 5
                to
                8 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Place brisket on a rack set in a roasting pan. Scatter onion and garlic slices over brisket and add
                water to
                roasting pan. Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil.

            </li>
